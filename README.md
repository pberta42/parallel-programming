This repository contains a collection of projects and experiments developed for my **Parallel Programming** coursework.  
Each project explores different techniques and frameworks for **concurrent, parallel, and distributed computing**.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Multithreading and synchronization  
- Message passing and distributed systems  
- GPU and data-parallel programming  
- Performance analysis and scalability  

---

## 📁 Repository Structure
```
/project1-waiter/ # Intro to parallelism using threads
/project2-gradient/ # Message Passing Interface (MPI) examples
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run
Each project folder includes:
- `README.md` with build/run instructions
- Example input/output data

---

## 📚 Purpose
These projects were built to deepen my understanding of:
- How parallelism can accelerate computation
- Profiling and optimizing parallel workloads
